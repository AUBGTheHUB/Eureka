# Eureka

 ### Instructions:  
 
 
 Clone the repo with ```git clone https://github.com/theHubAUBGproject/Eureka.git```.  
 Get Django using ```pip3 install Django==3.0.3```. It's highly suggested that you do this in a venv.  
 You can run the test server by using:
 ```bash
 $ cd eureka
 $ python manage.py runserver
 ```
 In case you have both Python 2 and 3, you should use:
```bash
 $ python3 manage.py runserver
```

Your Python version should be at least 3.6 for this version of Django.

### Contribution Guide:

 Fork the repository and then  
 ```$ git clone yourforkedcopy.git```   
 Add upstream using ```$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/AUBGTheHUB/Eureka.git```.  
 This lets you use ```$ git pull origin master``` to pull the most recent changes from the main repo.  
 Make your changes, do your commits and push the changes to the forked repo.
 Do a pull request against Eureka/master to request to merge your changes.
